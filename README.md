# üöñ Chicago Taxi Tips Analysis üí∞  

This project leverages **BigQuery** as a data warehouse, **dbt** for data transformation, and **Google Sheets** for final storage and visualization.  

### üîç Overview  
Using the **‚ÄòChicago Taxi Trips‚Äô** dataset from BigQuery, the project identifies the **top 3 drivers** who earned the highest total tips in **April 2018**.  

The transformation layer in **dbt** then tracks how their earnings evolved over time, aggregating tips by **year and month** to calculate the percentage change. The final results are stored in **Google Sheets**, where an interactive visualization brings the insights to life.
